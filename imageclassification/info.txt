this project includes image calssification form an existing keras dataset known as cifar10

This dataset consists of 60,000 images divided into 10 target classes, with each category containing 6000 images of shape 32*32. This dataset contains images of low resolution (32*32), which allows researchers to try new algorithms. The 10 different classes of this dataset are:

Airplane
Car
Bird
Cat
Deer
Dog
Frog
Horse
Ship
Truck
